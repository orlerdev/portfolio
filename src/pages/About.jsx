            <SArticle>
              I started my journey in software development with freeCodeCamp.org. I completed the course in Responsive Web Design and then the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course. From there I moved onto Udemy.com where I continued learning the skills needed to pursue a career in this field. After retiring from the Navy, my family and I headed for San Antonio, TX where I enrolled in the Web Development program at Codeup. After 9-5, 5 days a week, for 20 weeks, I graduated the program with the rest of Bigfoot cohort. It was definitely a challenge, but it was worth it. I met some really great people, and learned a lot about developing as a professional. I really enjoyed working together with a team to complete our Capstone project, Dungeons and Dust Bunnies.  My favorite part of the project was collaborating with people from different backgrounds, and experiences. Someone always had a unique approach for a feature we wanted to implement, or a problem that needed solving. This is a great profession with an awesome community, and Iâ€™m really happy about being a part of it.
